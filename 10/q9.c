// Write a program that initializes a two-dimensional 3×5 array-of- double and uses a VLA based
// function to copy it to a second two-dimensional array. Also provide a VLA-based 
// function to display the contents of the two arrays. The two functions should be capable, 
// in general, of processing arbitrary N×M arrays. (If you don’t have access to a VLA-capable 
// compiler, use the traditional C approach of functions that can process an N×5 array).
