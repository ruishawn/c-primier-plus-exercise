// Write a function called string_in() that takes two string pointers as arguments. If 
// the second string is contained in the first string, have the function return the address 
// at which the contained string begins. For instance, string_in("hats", "at") would 
// return the address of the a in hats. Otherwise, have the function return the null pointer. 
// Test the function in a complete program that uses a loop to provide input values for 
// feeding to the function.
