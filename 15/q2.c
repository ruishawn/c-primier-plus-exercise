/*
Write a program that reads two binary strings as command-line arguments and prints 
the results of applying the ~ operator to each number and the results of applying the 
&, |, and ^ operators to the pair. Show the results as binary strings. (If you donâ€™t have a 
command-line environment available, have the program read the strings interactively.)
