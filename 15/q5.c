/*
Write a function that rotates the bits of an unsigned int by a specified number of bits 
to the left. For instance, rotate_l(x,4) would move the bits in x four places to the left, 
and the bits lost from the left end would reappear at the right end. That is, the bit moved 
out of the high-order position is placed in the low-order position. Test the function in a 
program.
